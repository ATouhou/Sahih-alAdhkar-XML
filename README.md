# Ṣaḥīḥ al-Adhkār XML

Ṣaḥīḥ al-Adhkār XML is about creating XML files for the book _Ṣaḥīḥ al-Adhkār_, a compilation of supplications from the works of Shaykh al-Albānī (May Allāh have mercy on him).

These XML files will be useful for anyone wanting to create applications or websites relating to the book. Initially, an Arabic only version will be worked on.
